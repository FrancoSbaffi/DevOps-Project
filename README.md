# Project Integrator (Feature Branch: feature/new-functionality)

This branch, `feature/new-functionality`, is dedicated to the isolated development of a new feature, ensuring the stability of both the `develop` and `master` branches. It allows:

- Local development and testing of the new functionality.
- Safe adjustments to configurations (Dockerfiles, HTML files, etc.) without risk.
- Seamless integration into `develop` once the feature is stable and well-tested.

## Benefits of This Workflow

As the sole developer, this approach helps me maintain the integrity of the main codebase while ensuring that new improvements are thoroughly tested before advancing towards production.
