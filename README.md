# (Staging Branch)

Welcome to the staging branch—the foundation of the development pipeline for this project. This is where all ideas, prototypes, experiments, and unconventional tests are implemented, free from the worry of breaking anything. Think of it as the workshop for trial and error, the "laboratory" where we see what works and what doesn't.

## Why Call It the "Lowest Level" Branch?

In this workflow, **staging** is like the basement of a tall building:

- Above it are more "polished" floors (like `develop` or `master`) where things are more refined. 
- Here in `staging`, however, we embrace freedom to test any changes without the need for neatness or completion.
- Imagine a warehouse filled with scrap, loose parts, prototypes, trials, and countless raw ideas. That's `staging`.
  
## What Happens Here?

- **Big Experiments:**  
  Add new services (perhaps an improvised app3), modify nginx.conf as many times as necessary, change volumes, bind mounts, images, and environment variables—all without concerns.

- **Testing Unstable Configurations:**  
  If something doesn't work, that's fine. We leave it as is; it might be useful later. If something works, great! It can be "promoted" to the feature/new-functionality branch for further development and refinement.

- **Deciding the Fate of Ideas:**  
  Anything that shows potential in staging—like functional code or promising configurations—gets carried over to `feature/new-functionality` for enhancement. If all goes well, it may eventually reach higher branches (develop, then master).

## What Happens to Things That Don’t Work?

Here’s the interesting part:

- In `staging`, we don’t delete things that don’t work. We keep them in place, just in case they inspire us or become useful for another experiment in the future. 
- The beauty of `staging` lies in being a creative space where what doesn't work today might find its purpose tomorrow.

## Summary

- **staging = Experimental Basement**: We test, trial, and explore freely.  
- Things that work: Get promoted to feature/new-functionality for deeper development..  
- Things that don’t work: Stay here for potential future use.

In essence, the staging branch is the perfect space for me, as the sole developer, to unleash creativity, play with configurations, test new Docker images, adjust docker-compose.yml repeatedly, and do so without affecting the more "serious" code in the upper branches.
